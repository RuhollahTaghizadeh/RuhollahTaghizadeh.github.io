summary: We use five machine learning techniques-Random Forest, M5P, Reduced Error Pruning Tree, Gaussian Processes, and Pace Regression-under two scenarios to predict soil erodibility. All five algorithms show a positive correlation between the soil erodibility factor and silt, sand, fine sand, bulk density, and infiltration.
