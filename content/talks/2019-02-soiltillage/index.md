summary: Soil texture is the most well-known composition in soil science. When separate components of the texture are predicted independently in digital soil mapping, there is no guarantee that the separate estimates will sum to 100%. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of different soil texture modelling methods on the estimation of available soil water capacity and the total amount of irrigation water required for wheat production.
