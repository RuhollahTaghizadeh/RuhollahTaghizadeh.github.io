summary: Soil salinization is an important threat for agriculture and environment in the eastern coast of Urmia hyper saline Lake. Predicting soil salinization requires rapid and low-cost measurement tools of soil salinity. It is hypothesized that remote sensing and visible near-infrared spectroscopy may offer a feasible method for that purpose.
