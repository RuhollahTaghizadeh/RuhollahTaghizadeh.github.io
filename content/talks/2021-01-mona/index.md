summary: The current research introduces a new integrated methodology for targeting the upgrading and improvement of coarse rain gauge networks in arid regions. The findings of the present research support the impression that remote sensing data is an excellent option for places with no or few rain gauges, as it enables the gathering of more frequent records at a higher resolution.
