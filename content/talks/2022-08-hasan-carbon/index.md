summary: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the RF model for predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of SOC content of the oasis and arid-agroecosystem area which the approach may be utilized in other similarly arid conditions. In general, the results showed that the RF model could be used for mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC content.
