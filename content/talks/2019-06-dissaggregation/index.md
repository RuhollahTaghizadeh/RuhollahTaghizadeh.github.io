summary: To increase detail in the polygon of conventional soil maps, we have produced a spatially disaggregated soil class map of a relatively flat agricultural plain using DSMART algorithm. DSMART works through resampled classification trees to estimate the probability of the existence of each possible soil classes and also to prepare the maps of the most probable soil class, second most probable, and so on in raster format.
