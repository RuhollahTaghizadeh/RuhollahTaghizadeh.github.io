summary: This work aimed to evaluate the applicability of nine machine learning models and their average for predicting the seasonal dust storm index (DSI) during 2000â€“2018 in arid regions. The results showed that the averaging method outperformed the other individual ML models in predicting DSI changes in all seasons.
