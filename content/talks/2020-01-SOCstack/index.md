summary: In this study, we introduced stacking ML models in two modes (standard mode and rescan mode) in order to improve the spatial prediction of SOC content at two contrasting climatic regions (arid and sub-humid). The stacking ensemble modeling in both modes indicated the higher performance in comparison to the individual models.
