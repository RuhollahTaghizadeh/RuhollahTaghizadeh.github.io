summary: The main purpose of this study, is to evaluate an advanced feature selection technique, artificial bee colony algorithm, to reduce the number of auxiliary variables derived from a digital elevation model and remotely sensed data. A combination of depth functions and data miner methods were applied for three-dimensional mapping of soil organic matter in Big Sioux River watershed, South Dakota, USA.
