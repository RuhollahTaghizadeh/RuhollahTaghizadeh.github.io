summary: Sixteen models were used for describing the PSD. Results indicated that the models had acceptable accuracy for describing the PSD curves. Importantly, the Jaky model, with only one fitting parameter was able to accurately describe PSD. Therefore, the parameter P in the Jaky model was used for spaÂ­tial mapping of the PSD curve using DSM techniques.
