summary: This study aimed to map SOC lateral, and vertical variations down to 1 m depth. Six data mining techniques namely; artificial neural networks, support vector regression, k-nearest neighbor, random forests, regression tree models, and genetic programming were combined with equal-area smoothing splines to develop, and compare their effectiveness in achieving this aim. .
