summary: The aim of this research was to evaluate and test the suitability of spline functions and spatial data-mining models to predict vertical and horizontal distributions of soil PSFs. In addition, we explored whether improvements in prediction could be achieved with the use of two techniques for input selection (i.e. ant colony optimization and correlation-based feature selection).
