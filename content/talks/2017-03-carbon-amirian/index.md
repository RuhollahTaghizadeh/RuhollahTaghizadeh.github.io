summary: This paper investigates the 3D distribution of SOC to a depth of 1 m in a 4600-ha area with different land uses under the irrigated farming, dry farming, orchards, range plants on the Gachsaran formation, and range plants. Results showed that depth functions combined with digital soil mapping techniques provide a promising approach to evaluate 3D SOC distribution
