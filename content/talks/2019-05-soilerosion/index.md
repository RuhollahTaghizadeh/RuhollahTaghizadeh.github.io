summary: In the Great Plains region of the USA, a recent conversion of the grasslands to cropland impacting the soil erosion and hence the crop productivity. The GIS-Enabled Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation was used to estimate the soil erosion at the watershed scale in the present study. Soil erosion in the current study was predicted for the Big Sioux River watershed scale using the spatial data downloaded from the easily available online sources.
