summary: A methodology framework was proposed for identifying the environmental controls of dust pollution in western Iran using game theory and different machine-learning models. Here, we observed that the DNN model was most effective in predicting DSI in the cold and warm months of western Iran when compared to the MLR, GPR, XGB, and RF models.
