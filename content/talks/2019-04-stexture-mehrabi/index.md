summary: The objectives of the present study are (i) to predict soil texture fractions, from the various particle size fractions data using data mining models, including a regression tree, an artificial neural network and a neuro-fuzzy system, and (ii) to study the impact of auxiliary data, such as terrain parameters, satellite images, geomorphological maps, and spectrometric data for predicting the spatial distribution of clay, sand, and silt contents.
