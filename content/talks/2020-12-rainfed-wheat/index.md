summary: The study regionâ€™s soil quality is mostly poor and moderate, therefore, more attempts should be made to apply organic inputs like farm yard manure, compost or green manure and potassium fertilizer in rainfed wheat fields. Generally, the soils of the Inceptisol order exhibited greater soil quality and rainfed wheat yield than soils of the Entisol order.
