summary: We attempt in this study to investigate soil salinity variation (vertical and lateral) for a study area within Iran. Here, using soil data base and the full suite of auxiliary data— including the predicted maps of ECav and ECah, ETM+ images, geomorphology map, and terrain parameters—regression tree models were built for each of the standard depths.
