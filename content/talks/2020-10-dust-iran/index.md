summary: In this work, seasonal variations of vegetation cover and wind erosion activity level over Iran for a long-term period from 2000 to 2018 were investigated using the NDVIA and DCA, respectively. The change trends and the rate of changes in the study variables were determined by the Mann-Kendall test and sen's slop estimator.
