summary: This study evaluated the effects of slope and land use on the quality of agricultural land in Kurdistan Province. This was done using three indices (SQIa, SQIn, and SQIw), two scoring methods, and the TDS and MDS approaches for calculating them. K, pH, P, MWD, and CEC were the properties selected for the MDS using PCA analysis.
