summary: Electromagnetic induction has been used to characterize the spatial distribution of salinity. However, most studies have been undertaken to map the areal distribution of the average profile salinity using measurements of the apparent electrical conductivity. In this study, an EM38 was used to map the distribution of salinity with depth.
