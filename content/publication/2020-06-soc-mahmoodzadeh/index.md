summary: This study shows that ML algorithms can be successfully used for mapping SOC and their uncertainty at a large scale in western Iran where there is a wide range in climate, land use and terrain attributes. The procedural structure permits enhancement of the DSM process without loss of performance, selecting only the most important variables and the best model.
