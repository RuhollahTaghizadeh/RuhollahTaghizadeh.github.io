summary: We implemented a ML algorithm using SVR with wavelet transformation of the covariates within a DSM framework to map and predict soil salinity in central Iran. Here, using a soil database and a full suite of covariates— derived from remote sensing data, terrain attributes, and climatic data—SVR and W-SVR models were built for each of the standard soil depth increments.
