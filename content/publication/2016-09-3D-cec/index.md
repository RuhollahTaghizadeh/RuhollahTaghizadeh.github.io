summary: This study evaluates the performances of a combination of genetic programming and soil depth functions to map the three-dimensional distribution of cation exchange capacity in a semiarid region located in Baneh region, Iran. Overall, results indicated the topsoil can be reasonably well predicted; however, the subsoil prediction needs to be improved.
