subtitle: 'I have implemented this project to answer three main questions: How to apply and compare ML models for soil mapping? How to improve the performances of ML models? How to train ML models with a small dataset?'
summary: 'One of my most impressive projects is my design and development of a powerful tool and technique to define the role of every component within a soil ecosystem. I  studied ML models and statistic models and applied them to the production of high-resolution soil information.'
