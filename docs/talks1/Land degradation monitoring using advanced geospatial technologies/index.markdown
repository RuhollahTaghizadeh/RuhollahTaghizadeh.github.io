subtitle: 'Soil degradation is the decline in soil condition caused by its improper use or poor management, usually for agricultural, industrial, or urban purposes. It is a serious environmental problem.'
summary: 'Soil degradations are predominant environmental problem world-wide their accurate assessment is essential for determining appropriate ways to deal with land degradation, for better soil and crop management. In this project, the applicability of machine learning models and remote sensing is evaluated to monitor and assess land degradations such as soil salinity, soil erosion, and air/water/soil pollution.

## Summary
In this project, we have closely monitored land use change effects on land degradation, soil quality reduction, and pollution. Importantly, we investigated the applicability of remote sensing and machine learning for mapping and monitoring soil salinity in three-dimensional space. Moreover, we studied the temporal and spatial pattern of soil salinity in arid regions and simulate the trend of soil salinity for the future.  

## Objectives

I have implemented this project to answer three main questions:

1)	How to estimate and monitor soil salinity in order to solve the agricultural issues using machine learning models. [**article1**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016706120325489?via%3Dihub); [**article2**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016706120326136).

2)	How to quantify and assess soil erosion and soil quality using machine learning and statistical methods. [**article1**](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-8789/3/3/43); [**article2**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016706117314003).

3)	How to assess and map the soil, air, and water pollution using machine learning and statistical methods. [**article1**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X21009523?via%3Dihub); [**article2**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/9/1698).
